## Getting Started

The project and model rely on Python within Jupyter Notebooks and uses numpy, pandas and matplotlib.

### Prerequisites

Install Anaconda (Python 3.6 version) from https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Once installed open a terminal (Linux) or command line (Windows)

Install Jupyter Notebooks

```
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

Use Anaconda to install numpy, pandas, matplotlib

```
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

### Download The Notebook

Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/timothyr/anomaly-detection.git
cd anomaly-detection
```

### Running The Notebook

```
jupyter notebooks
```

Go to your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Anomaly%20Detection.ipynb` (Link may be different, check your terminal)

If Jupyter Notebook enters an interactive shell, press **q** to quit and it will show the notebook address like the one above.
